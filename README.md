Ask Your CSV is a Streamlit web application that allows you to interactively ask questions about a CSV file using the power of natural language processing.

## Features

- Upload a CSV file.
- Ask questions about the data in the CSV file.
- Utilizes LangChain Experimental Agents and OpenAI for natural language processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable.
- Run the application: `streamlit run main.py`
- Upload a CSV file and start asking questions!

## Learning Source

This project was developed as part of learning concepts related to agents, natural language processing, and the LangChain Experimental library.

## My learning throughout this project

I learnt about the concept of "agents" throughout this project. Following are my learnings:
- "agents" serve as intelligent components designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
- These agents play crucial roles in handling user interactions with CSV data, attaching with LLM and CSV as LLM is not directly capable to do this.
- Their responsibilities include receiving and interpreting natural language queries, processing and understanding the input, and generating relevant responses or actions.
- Acting autonomously, these agents enhance the interaction between users and the data, showcasing their versatility in tasks ranging from chat-based conversations to executing actions based on user input.
- Agents in this project represent the dynamic bridge between users and the LLM capabilities, providing the facility to interact with CSV data.
